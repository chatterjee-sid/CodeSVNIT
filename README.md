# CodeSVNIT
Repository storing my code files created for assignments and mini projects in SVNIT Surat, starting from Semester 2

For any juniors reading this. In case you want to take some idea for a question in your assignments, possibly given to my batch as well, then you are free to use them. Just one thing. Please execute the files in your system and make the necessary changes.
